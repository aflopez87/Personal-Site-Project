# Personal-Site-Project
Live Demonstration
You can go to Gustavo's Personal SiteLinks to an external site. to see a sample of what we are trying to build.

What are we trying to make?
You have been recently hired at FullStack Solutions as a junior developer. Your project manager, Calliope, sends you the following email to welcome you to the team and provide details on your first assignment. 

An email from calliope saying "Welcome to FullStack Solutions! We‚Äôre so happy you are joining our team.  I‚Äôm Calliope, your team‚Äôs project manager. Fullstack Solutions is currently competing for several different contracts to build web apps, including corporate websites, startup proofs-of-concept, and enhancements to some portals for our local government. As part of the process we are submitting brief bios and portfolios for each team member. Submit a Github link to your working repository in our ticket tracker before the end of the day, and let me know if you need any help or clarification!"

Calliope has asked you to create a personal site with a brief bio. It is a chance to show off who you are, what you are about, and what you have accomplished. We will focus on three main areas: the landing page, an about page, and a portfolio page.

You will get the chance to revisit this project as we learn new techniques, so do not worry about perfecting it during your first pass. The goal here is to practice writing semantic HTML, basic CSS, and Javascript. You must use a GitHub repository.

üè†Home Page
The landing page is your first impression. You can include a photo, your mission statement, and something which defines you. In our example, we have included a quote.

üë§ About Page
An about page is a place for people to get to know you. You should include your interests, and things you are good at, and in general you should pull back enough of the curtain into your life to interest a potential employer in you as a person.

üñºÔ∏è Portfolio Page
The portfolio page is the meat and potatoes of your personal site, here you want to include the projects you have worked on. For each project you wish to showcase, you should include the name of your project, a brief description, a screenshot, and a link to where it lives on the web.

Note: You can use Lorem Ipsum for placeholder content, but it would be great if you included actual content.

üì© Contact Page
 The contact page is the last part of your personal site. Make sure to include a form that asks for someone's name, email, and message they would like to send. The contact form will also have a submit button that will console.log a success message when successfully filled out.

Note: The form does not have to send an actual email, but you are welcome to have the button direct to a success.html file with a success message.

There are three tabs below to help you stay organized as you work on this simulation.
