            <h2>About me</h2>
            
            <p>Technology has been had a deep impact in my upbringing as a millenial born during the age of the internet. I've played games, learned skills, and connected with people through the magic box plugged into this ethereal realm called the internet. I've always had a fascination of how things worked which is what led to me earning my degree in mechanical engineering and now pursuing a my newfound interest in web development.</p>

            <h3>My hobbies include:</h3>

            <section id="hobbies">
            <div>
                <p><br><em>Practicing martial arts. </em><br>I've trained in martial arts since i was 8 years old. I've practiced taekwondo, karate, capoeira, and muay thai but have a deep passion for judo. While I'm not a competitive practitioner, the sport keeps me motivated to maintain my fitness and provides a challenging but satisfying outlet.</p>

                <p><em>Gaming.</em><br>I see games as an interactive escape where some of my most cherished memories were playing Parcheesi and Monopoly with my siblings and cousins. Video games with some exceptions are digital boardgames that have allowed me to enjoy the challenges of problem solving and let me enjoy a variety of designs, mechanics, art, and stories.</p>

                <p><em>Experiencing Film and Live stage perfomances.</em><br>Having attended a high school for the performing arts, I've always held a an appreciation for the craft. I've had the chance to see a good mixture of performances both on small stages and broadway. One of the quirkiest performances I remember seeing was actually called Hyprov which as a combination with a hypnotist and improv comedian making for one of the most unique experiences I've ever seen!</p>
